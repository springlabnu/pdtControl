# pdtControl
Program for well-plate setup and light source exposure control for in-vitro PDT administration.


## Overview

Typical in-vitro photodynamic experiments involve illuminating a well-plate with varying doses of phototoxic light. This program stremlines the process of planning and executing these experiments in the lab. Plan your well plate exposures by adding the desired light doses in the Setup tab. Then proceed to the Run tab to view the illumination times required for each well. Expose each well, one-by-one, and program keeps track of your progress while monitoring the LED temperature.
