## Overview

Typical in-vitro photodynamic experiments involve illuminating a well-plate with varying doses of phototoxic light. This program streamlines the process of planning and executing these experiments in the lab. Plan well-plate exposures by entering the desired light doses in the Setup tab. Then proceed to the Run tab to view the illumination times required for each well. Expose each well, one-by-one, with automated shutter control, temperature monitor, and countdown sequence. The program automatically keeps track of progress through the plate.

## System Requirements

This software requires a Windows operating system for full operation and control of the DAQ card. Basic functionality (*i.e.*, experiment planning) is possible on any OS. See the User Guide for a complete list of hardware and software.

This app was written in MATLAB using AppDesigner (R2019a).
