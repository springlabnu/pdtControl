# pdtControl
App for well-plate setup and light source exposure control for in-vitro PDT administration.

## Overview

Typical in-vitro photodynamic experiments involve illuminating a well-plate with varying doses of phototoxic light. This program streamlines the process of planning and executing these experiments in the lab. First, plan well-plate exposures by entering the desired light doses for each well in the Setup tab. Then proceed to the Run tab to view the illumination times required for each well. Expose each well, one-by-one, with automated shutter control, temperature monitoring, and countdown sequence. The program automatically keeps track of progress through the plate minimizing risk of accidental double exposures.

## System Requirements

This software requires a Windows operating system for full operation and control of the DAQ card. Basic functionality (*i.e.*, experiment planning) is possible on any OS. See the User Guide for a complete list of hardware and software.

This app was written in MATLAB using AppDesigner (R2019a).
