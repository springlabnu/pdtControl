This document provides instructions on how to assemble a do-it-yourself LED light source for photodynamic experimentation in the lab.


## Introduction

Access to high-power, stable, and reliable light sources is critical to any photodynamic research lab. However, light sources for photodynamic therapy (PDT) are costly, which limits the broad adoption of fundamental experimentation of photodynamic processes in the scientific community. This kit provides a hands-on, DIY protocol for assembling an LED array capable of efficient photodynamic excitation.
